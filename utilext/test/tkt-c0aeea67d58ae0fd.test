# Regression test for SQLite ticket c0aeea67d58ae0fd
#
# The SQLite core showed a problem with the like operator with an escape clause
# of { ESCAPE '_' }.
#
# Our implementation deals with this situation in passing since we have omitted
# the "matchOne" assignment that is used in the SQLite core (we are not doing
# globbing), but make sure we pass the test anyway.
